                    <p> I was born in  Venezuela, I am 38 years old,     I have 2 children, my oldest daughter is 6      years old and my youngest child is 3 years      old, my life is dedicated to them, to give      them the best and that is why we moved to       the United States in November 2017. I like      all sports, especially basketball, I'm a        fan of the Utah Jazz, although I think the      best time was that of Karl Malone y John        Stockton.  My family and I have loved this      city, and we have many wishes to know all       its natural wonders.
